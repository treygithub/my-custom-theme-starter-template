# my-custom-theme-starter-template
Boilerplate for writing your own custom WordPress template theme in PHP HTML CSS JavaScript 

use this to start from scratch and be up and running in no time... no boiler plate stuff from other sites used. All hand coded and original. you may want to use something else if your want to use css preprocessors or woo commerce you can get thoes bioler plates from underscore.me or something like that. This is suited best for minimum edit needed to hit the floor running... start editing the css comments at the top to your site needs, and go from there. 
Happy Hacking!
